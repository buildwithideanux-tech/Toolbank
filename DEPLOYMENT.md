## 🔄 How Continuous Deployment Works

```
Local Changes → Git Push → GitHub → Netlify Build → Live Site
     ↓              ↓         ↓           ↓           ↓
  You edit      Auto push   Webhook   Auto build   2-3 mins
```

## 🛠️ Quick Deployment Commands

### **Method 1: Interactive Deploy (Recommended)**
```bash
npm run deploy
```
- Prompts for commit message
- Shows what changes will be deployed
- Handles the entire process automatically

### **Method 2: Quick Deploy**

```

- Perfect for small changes

### **Method 3: Manual Deploy**

git push origin master
```

## 📊 Monitoring Commands

### **Check Status**
```bash
npm run status
# Shows what files have changed
```

### **View Recent Deployments**
```bash
npm run logs
# Shows last 10 commits/deployments
```

## 🎯 Deployment Workflow Examples

### **Adding a New Tool**
```bash
# 1. Create your new tool
# 2. Test locally
npm run dev

# 3. Deploy to production
npm run deploy
# Enter message: "Add new BMI calculator tool"
```

### **Fixing a Bug**
```bash
# 1. Fix the issue
# 2. Quick deploy
npm run deploy:quick
```

### **Major Updates**
```bash
# 1. Make your changes
# 2. Test thoroughly
npm run build

# 3. Deploy with detailed message
npm run deploy
# Enter message: "Major update: Add analytics and improve SEO"
```

## 🌐 Your Live Site

**Production URL**: `https://your-site-name.netlify.app`

### **What Happens After You Deploy**

1. **GitHub receives your push** (instant)
2. **Netlify webhook triggers** (5-10 seconds)
3. **Build process starts** (1-2 minutes)
   - `npm install` (installs dependencies)
   - `npm run build` (builds production version)
   - Deploys to CDN
4. **Site goes live** (30 seconds)

**Total time**: 2-3 minutes from push to live

## 📱 Netlify Dashboard

Monitor your deployments at: `https://app.netlify.com`

### **What You Can See**:
- ✅ Build status (success/failed)
- 📊 Build logs (if something goes wrong)
- 🌐 Deploy previews
- 📈 Site analytics
- ⚙️ Environment variables

## 🔧 Environment Variables

Your production environment variables:

```bash
# Site Configuration
NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL=https://your-site-name.netlify.app
NODE_ENV=production

# Analytics (Add these after setting up Google services)
NEXT_PUBLIC_GA_MEASUREMENT_ID=G-XXXXXXXXXX
NEXT_PUBLIC_GTM_ID=GTM-XXXXXXX
NEXT_PUBLIC_ADSENSE_CLIENT_ID=ca-pub-XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
```

**To update environment variables**:
1. Go to Netlify Dashboard
2. Site Settings → Environment Variables
3. Edit/Add variables
4. Trigger a new deploy

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### **Build Fails**
```bash
# Check what's wrong locally first
npm run build

# If it works locally, check:
# 1. Environment variables in Netlify
# 2. Build logs in Netlify dashboard
# 3. Dependencies in package.json
```

### **Site Loads but Features Don't Work**
```bash
# Check browser console for errors
# Verify environment variables are set correctly
# Test in incognito mode (ad blockers can interfere)
```

### **Deploy Command Not Working**
```bash
# Make sure you're in the right directory
cd /path/to/toolbank

# Check if deploy.js exists
ls deploy.js

# Run manually
node deploy.js
```

## 🎯 Best Practices

### **Commit Messages**
- ✅ "Add new loan calculator tool"
- ✅ "Fix BMI calculation bug"
- ✅ "Update homepage design"
- ❌ "update"
- ❌ "fix"

### **Testing Before Deploy**
```bash
# Always test locally first
npm run dev

# Test production build
npm run build
npm start
```

### **Deployment Frequency**
- 🟢 **Small changes**: Deploy immediately
- 🟡 **Medium changes**: Test locally, then deploy
- 🔴 **Major changes**: Test thoroughly, deploy during low traffic

## 📈 Monitoring Your Site

### **After Each Deployment, Check**:
1. **Site loads correctly**: Visit your live URL
2. **New features work**: Test what you changed
3. **No broken links**: Click around
4. **Mobile works**: Test on phone
5. **Analytics tracking**: Check Google Analytics

### **Weekly Monitoring**:
- Google Search Console for SEO issues
- Google Analytics for user behavior
- Netlify Analytics for performance
- AdSense for revenue (after approval)
